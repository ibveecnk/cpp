This is a repo dedicated to learning fundamentals of c++.

## Notes

### Compiling

Compiling c++ code via cc and gcc often results in linker errors. A workaround I found is to use the g++ compiler, which automatically links most of the essential libraries.

```
$ g++ [file to compile]
$ ./compiled_file
```
